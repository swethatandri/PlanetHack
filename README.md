# LifeBalance


#About:

LifeBalance is an app designed for you to record and maintain your health, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. Users can create entries in your own journal that will record their symptoms, mood, water intake, and stress level every day in addition to entries. These are private and can only be seen by the one that creates them!

In addition, LifeBalance has a feature that allows users to input how often they wash their hands per day, and they will receive feedback based on the hourly increments they have selected. This will allow users to stay safe while not going over or under board. 

#Technologies:

This application was created on Android Studio and is applicable to android mobile devices and tablets. To create LifeBalance, we used HTML, CSS, XML, Javascript, and Java. 


#Implication

We believe this project has many practical implications as it is very convenient to use and provides resources to help with physical and mental health during the pandemic.
